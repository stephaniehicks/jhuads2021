# Motivation

Analyzing text data such as Twitter content, books or 
news articles is commonly performed in data science. 

In this lecture, we will be asking the following questions: 

> Which are the most commonly used words from Jane Austen's 
novels? Which are the most positive or negative words? How does
the sentiment (e.g. positive vs negative) of the text change
across each novel? 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1YUH7-W5AL.jpg")
```

To answer these questions, we will need to learn about a few
things. Specifically, 

1. How to convert words in documents to a _tidy text_ format using the `tidytext` R package
2. A little bit about [sentiment analysis](https://www.tidytextmining.com/sentiment.html)

# Tidy text

In previous courses, you have learned about the tidy
data principles and the `tidyverse` R packages as a way to make 
handling data easier and more effective. These packages depend
on data being formatted in a particular way. The idea with 
tidy text is to treat text as data frames of individual words 
and apply the same tidy data principles to make text mining tasks 
easier and consistent with already developed tools. 

First let's recall what a _tidy_ data format means. 

### What is a _tidy_ format? 

First, the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org) is 

> "an opinionated collection of R packages designed 
for data science. All packages share an underlying 
philosophy and common APIs." 

Another way of putting it is that it is a set of packages 
that are useful specifically for data manipulation, 
exploration and visualization with a common philosophy. 

### What is this common philosphy? 

The common philosophy is called _"tidy"_ data. It is 
a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset
to its structure.

In _tidy_ data:

* Each variable forms a column.
* Each observation forms a row.
* Each type of observational unit forms a table.

```{r out.width = "95%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("http://r4ds.had.co.nz/images/tidy-1.png")
```

Working with **tidy data is useful** because it creates a structured way of
organizing data values within a data set. This makes the data analysis 
process more efficient and simplifies the development of data analysis tools
that work together. 

In this way, you can focus on the problem you are
investigating, rather than the uninteresting logistics of data.  

### What is a _tidy text_ format? 

When dealing with _text_ data, the _tidy text_ format is 
defined as a table **with one-token-per-row**, where a _token_ 
is a meaningful unit of text (e.g. a word, pair of words, 
sentence, paragraph, etc). 

Using a given set of token, we can 
_tokenize_ text, or split the text into the defined tokens of 
interest along the rows. We will learn more about how to do
this using functions in the 
[`tidytext`](https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext) R package. 

In contrast, other data structures that are commonly used 
to store text data in text mining applications: 

* **string**: text can, of course, be stored as strings, i.e., character vectors, within R, and often text data is first read into memory in this form.
* **corpus**: these types of objects typically contain raw strings annotated with additional metadata and details.
* **document-term matrix**: This is a sparse matrix describing a collection (i.e., a corpus) of documents with one row for each document and one column for each term. The value in the matrix is typically word count. 

I won't describing these other formats in greater detail, but
encourage you to read about them if interested in this topic. 

### Why is this format useful? 

One of the biggest advantages of transforming text data to 
the tidy text format is that it allows data to transition 
smoothly between other packages that adhere to the `tidyverse` 
framework (e.g. `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, etc). 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '90%', fig.cap="A flowchart of a typical text analysis using tidy data principles."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.tidytextmining.com/images/tmwr_0101.png")
```

[[image source](https://www.tidytextmining.com/images/tmwr_0101.png)]


In addition, a user can transition between the tidy text 
format for e.g data visualization with `ggplot2`, but then also 
convert data to other data structures (e.g. document-term matrix) 
that is commonly used in machine learning applications. 

### How does it work? 

The main workhorse function in the `tidytext` R package to 
tokenize text a data frame is the `unnest_tokens(tbl, output, input)`
function.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?unnest_tokens
```

In addition to the data frame (`tbl`), the function needs two
basic arguments: 

1. `output` or the output column name that will be 
created (e.g. string) as the text is unnested into it
2. `input` or input column name that the text comes from and gets split

Let's try out the `unnest_tokens()` function using the
first paragraph in the preface of Roger's 
[R Programming for Data Science](https://leanpub.com/rprogramming) book. 

First, we load a few R packages

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
library(tidytext) ## needs to be installed
library(janeaustenr) ## needs to be installed
```

And then we load in the text 

```{r}
peng_preface <- 
  c("I started using R in 1998 when I was a college undergraduate working on my senior thesis.", 
    "The version was 0.63.",  
    "I was an applied mathematics major with a statistics concentration and I was working with Dr. Nicolas Hengartner on an analysis of word frequencies in classic texts (Shakespeare, Milton, etc.).", 
    "The idea was to see if we could identify the authorship of each of the texts based on how frequently they used certain words.", 
    "We downloaded the data from Project Gutenberg and used some basic linear discriminant analysis for the modeling.",
    "The work was eventually published and was my first ever peer-reviewed publication.", 
    "I guess you could argue it was my first real 'data science' experience.")

peng_preface
```

Turns out Roger performed a similar analysis as an 
undergraduate student!

He goes to say that back then no one was 
using R (but a little bit of something called S-PLUS), so 
I can only imagine how different it was to accomplish a task like the one 
we are going to do today compared to when he was an undergraduate. 

Here we use the `tibble()` function to construct a 
data frame from the character strings in `peng_preface`. 

```{r}
peng_preface_df <- tibble(line=1:7, text=peng_preface)
peng_preface_df
```

### Text Mining and Tokens

Next, we will use the `unnest_tokens()` function where we will 
call the output column to be created `word` and the input
column `text` from the `peng_preface_df`. 

```{r}
peng_token <- 
  peng_preface_df %>% 
  unnest_tokens(output = word, input = text, token = "words")

peng_token %>% head()
peng_token %>% tail()
```

The argument `token="words"` defines the unit for 
tokenization. The default is `"words"`, but there are 
lots of other options. 

For example, we could tokenize by `"characters"`: 

```{r}
peng_preface_df %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text, token = "characters") %>% 
  head()
```

or something called [ngrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram), 
which is defined by Wikipedia as a 
_"contiguous sequence of n items from a given sample of text or speech"_

```{r}
peng_preface_df %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text, token = "ngrams", n=3) %>% 
  head()
```

Another option is to use the `character_shingles` option, 
which is similar to tokenizing like `ngrams`, except the 
units are characters instead of words. 

```{r}
peng_preface_df %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text, token = "character_shingles", n = 4) %>% 
  head()
```

You can also create custom functions for tokenization. 

```{r}
peng_preface_df %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text, token = stringr::str_split, pattern = " ") %>% 
  head()
```


# Example: text from works of Jane Austen

We will use the text from six published novels from Jane Austen, 
which are available in the 
[`janeaustenr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janeaustenr/index.html)
R package. The [authors](https://www.tidytextmining.com/tidytext.html#tidyausten)
describe the format:  

> "The package provides the text in a one-row-per-line format, where 
a line is this context is analogous to a literal printed line in a 
physical book.
>
> The package contains:
>
> * `sensesensibility`: Sense and Sensibility, published in 1811
> * `prideprejudice`: Pride and Prejudice, published in 1813
> * `mansfieldpark`: Mansfield Park, published in 1814
> * `emma`: Emma, published in 1815
> * `northangerabbey`: Northanger Abbey, published posthumously in 1818
> * `persuasion`: Persuasion, also published posthumously in 1818
>
> There is also a function `austen_books()` that returns a tidy data frame of all 6 novels."

Let's load in the text from `prideprejudice` and look at 
how the data are stored. 

```{r}
library(janeaustenr)
head(prideprejudice, 20)
```

We see each line is in a character vector with elements of about 70 characters. 

Similar to what we did above with Roger's preface, we can turn the text of 
character strings into a data frame and then convert it into a 
one-row-per-line dataframe using the `unnest_tokens()` function. 

```{r}
pp_book_df <- tibble(text = prideprejudice) 
  
pp_book_df %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text, token="words")
```

We can also divide it by paragraphs:

```{r}
pp_book_df %>% 
  unnest_tokens(output = paragraph, input = text, token="paragraphs")
```

**Note**: what you name the output column, e.g. `paragraph` in this 
case, doesn't affect it, it's just good to give it a consistent 
name. 

We could also divide it by sentence:

```{r}
pp_book_df %>%
    unnest_tokens(output = sentence, input = text, token = "sentences") 
```

**Note**: this is tricked by terms like "Mr." and "Mrs."

One neat trick is that we can unnest by two layers: paragraph 
and then word. This lets us keep track of which paragraph is which.

```{r}
paragraphs <- 
  pp_book_df %>%
    unnest_tokens(output = paragraph, input = text, token = "paragraphs") %>%
    mutate(paragraph_number = row_number()) 

paragraphs
```

**Note**: We use `mutate()` to annotate a paragraph number 
quantity to keep track of paragraphs in the original format. 

```{r}
paragraphs %>%
    unnest_tokens(output = word, input = paragraph)
```

We notice there are many what are called _stop words_ ("the", "of", 
"to", and so forth in English). Often in text analysis, we will want 
to remove stop words because stop words are words that are not useful 
for an analysis. We can remove stop words (kept in the `tidytext`
dataset `stop_words`) with an `anti_join()`.

```{r}
data(stop_words)

table(stop_words$lexicon)

stop_words %>% 
  head(n=10)
```


```{r}
words_by_paragraph <- 
  paragraphs %>%
    unnest_tokens(word, paragraph) %>%
    anti_join(stop_words)

words_by_paragraph 
```

Because we have stored our data in a tidy dataset, we 
can use `tidyverse` packages for exploratory data analysis. 

For example, here we use `dplyr`'s `count()` function 
to find the most common words in the book

```{r}
words_by_paragraph %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  head()
```

Then use `ggplot2` to plot the most commonly used words
from the book. 

```{r}
words_by_paragraph %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(n > 150) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, n)) +
  geom_col() +
  xlab(NULL) +
  coord_flip()
```

We can also do this for all of her books using the `austen_books()`
object

```{r}
austen_books() %>% 
  head()
```

We can do some data wrangling that keep tracks of the line number 
and chapter (using a regex) to find where all the chapters are. 

```{r}
original_books <- 
  austen_books() %>%
  group_by(book) %>%
  mutate(linenumber = row_number(),
         chapter = cumsum(str_detect(text, regex("^chapter [\\divxlc]",
                                                 ignore_case = TRUE)))) %>%
  ungroup()

original_books
```

Finally, we can restructure it to a one-token-per-row format 
using the `unnest_tokens()` function and remove stop words
using the `anti_join()` function in `dplyr`. 

```{r}
tidy_books <- original_books %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words)

tidy_books
```

Here are the most commonly used words across all of Jane Austen's 
books. 

```{r}
tidy_books %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(n > 600) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, n)) +
  geom_col() +
  xlab(NULL) +
  coord_flip()
```



# Sentiment Analysis

In the previous section, we explored the _tidy text_ format
and showed how we can calculate things such as word frequency. 

Next, we are going to look at something called _opinion mining_ or 
_sentiment analysis_. The 
[tidytext authors](https://www.tidytextmining.com/sentiment.html) write: 

> _"When human readers approach a text, we use our understanding 
of the emotional intent of words to infer whether a section 
of text is positive or negative, or perhaps characterized by 
some other more nuanced emotion like surprise or disgust. 
We can use the tools of text mining to approach the emotional
content of text programmatically, as shown in the figure below"_

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '90%', fig.cap="A flowchart of a typical text analysis that uses tidytext for sentiment analysis."}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.tidytextmining.com/images/tmwr_0201.png")
```

[[image source](https://www.tidytextmining.com/images/tmwr_0201.png)]


> _"One way to analyze the sentiment of a text is to consider the text 
as a combination of its individual words and the sentiment content of 
the whole text as the sum of the sentiment content of the individual 
words. This isn’t the only way to approach sentiment analysis, but it 
is an often-used approach, and an approach that naturally takes 
advantage of the tidy tool ecosystem."_

Let's try using sentiment analysis on the Jane Austen books. 

## The `sentiments` dataset 

Inside the `tidytext` package are several sentiment 
lexicons. A few things to note:  

* The lexicons are based on unigrams (single words)
* The lexicons contain many English words and the words are assigned scores for positive/negative sentiment, and also possibly emotions like joy, anger, sadness, and so forth

You can use the `get_sentiments()` function to extract a specific
lexicon. 

The `nrc` lexicon **categorizes words into multiple categories** of 
positive, negative, anger, anticipation, disgust, fear,
joy, sadness, surprise, and trust

```{r}
get_sentiments("nrc")
```

The `bing` lexicon **categorizes words in a binary fashion**
into positive and negative categories

```{r}
get_sentiments("bing")
```

The `AFINN` lexicon **assigns words with a score that runs between 
-5 and 5**, with negative scores indicating negative sentiment and
positive scores indicating positive sentiment

```{r}
get_sentiments("afinn")
```

The authors of the `tidytext` package note: 

> _"How were these sentiment lexicons put together and validated? They 
were constructed via either crowdsourcing (using, for example, Amazon 
Mechanical Turk) or by the labor of one of the authors, and were validated
using some combination of crowdsourcing again, restaurant or movie reviews,
or Twitter data. Given this information, we may hesitate to apply these 
sentiment lexicons to styles of text dramatically different from what 
they were validated on, such as narrative fiction from 200 years ago.
While it is true that using these sentiment lexicons with, for example,
Jane Austen’s novels may give us less accurate results than with tweets 
sent by a contemporary writer, we still can measure the sentiment 
content for words that are shared across the lexicon and the text."_

Two other caveats: 

> _"Not every English word is in the lexicons because many English 
words are pretty neutral. It is important to keep in mind that these 
methods do not take into account qualifiers before a word, such as
in "no good" or "not true"; a lexicon-based method like this is based 
on unigrams only. For many kinds of text (like the narrative examples
below), there are not sustained sections of sarcasm or negated text, 
so this is not an important effect."_

and 

> _"One last caveat is that the size of the chunk of text that we
use to add up unigram sentiment scores can have an effect on an 
analysis. A text the size of many paragraphs can often have positive 
and negative sentiment averaged out to about zero, while sentence-sized 
or paragraph-sized text often works better."_


### Joining together tidy text data with lexicons

Now that we have our data in a tidy text format and we have 
learned about different types of lexicons in application for 
sentiment analysis, we can join the words together using a 
join function. 

For example, what are the most common joy words in the book 
_Emma_? Here we will use the `nrc` lexicon and join the `tidy_books` 
dataset with the `nrc_joy` lexicon using the `inner_join()` function
in `dplyr`. 

```{r}
nrc_joy <- get_sentiments("nrc") %>% 
  filter(sentiment == "joy")

tidy_books %>%
  filter(book == "Emma") %>%
  inner_join(nrc_joy) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

We can do things like investigate how the sentiment of the text
changes throughout each of Jane's novels. 

Here we will use the `bing` lexicon, find a sentiment score for 
each word, and then use `inner_join()`. 

```{r}
tidy_books %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>% 
  head()
```

Then we can count how many positive and negative words there are 
in each section of the books. We create an index to help us keep 
track of where we are in the narrative, which uses integer division, 
and counts up sections of 80 lines of text.

```{r}
tidy_books %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  count(book, index = linenumber %/% 80, sentiment) 
```

**Note**: The `%/%` operator does integer division (`x %/% y` is equivalent
to `floor(x/y)`) so the index keeps track of which 80-line section of 
text we are counting up negative and positive sentiment in.

Finally, we use `spread()` to have positive and negative counts in
different columns, and then use `mutate()` to calculate a net 
sentiment (positive - negative). 

```{r}
jane_austen_sentiment <- 
  tidy_books %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  count(book, index = linenumber %/% 80, sentiment) %>%
  spread(sentiment, n, fill = 0) %>%
  mutate(sentiment = positive - negative)

jane_austen_sentiment
```


Then we can plot the sentiment scores across the sections
of each novel: 

```{r, fig.height=10}
ggplot(jane_austen_sentiment, aes(index, sentiment, fill = book)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~book, ncol = 2, scales = "free_x")
```

We can see how the sentiment trajectory of the novel 
changes over time. 

### Word clouds 

You can also do things like create word clouds using the 
`wordcloud` package. 

```{r}
library(wordcloud)

tidy_books %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  count(word) %>%
  with(wordcloud(word, n, max.words = 100))
```
